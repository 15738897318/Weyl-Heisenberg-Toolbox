# Weyl-Heisenberg Bases Toolbox

This MATLAB toolbox was developed to study the optimal **Weyl-Heisenberg bases** and their properties in the field of signal processing and compression. The toolbox includes m-files that allow the synthesis and analysis of forming WH-functions and their corresponding orthogonal WH-bases.

# Installation
Add to MATLAB path toolbox scripts and samples folders:  
```matlab  
addpath('[...] /MATLAB/Scripts')  
addpath('[...] /MATLAB/Samples')  
addpath('[...] /MATLAB/Samples/Images')  
```
Run test script  
```matlab
>> plotgauss3
Number of samples = 128
Standard deviation = 0.00025
```
