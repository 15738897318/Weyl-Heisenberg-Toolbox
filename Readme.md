# Weyl-Heisenberg Bases Toolbox

This MATLAB toolbox was developed to study the optimal Weyl-Heisenberg bases and their properties in the field of signal processing and compression. The toolbox includes m-files that allow the synthesis and analysis of forming WH-functions and their corresponding orthogonal WH-bases.

# Installation
Add to MATLAB path toolbox folder: "MATLAB/Scripts" and folders with samples "MATLAB/Samples", "MATLAB/Samples/Images".  

# Referencess
A full list of references is given in a separate [file](https://github.com/asiryan/Weyl-Heisenberg-Bases-Toolbox/blob/master/References.pdf)
